# Conjugated-Polyelectrolytes-CPEs-DFT-Structures
Geometry optimised structures for conjugated polyelectrolytes based on P3HT-block-P(EO-graft-PEG)-block-polycarbonate, where polycarbonates are functionalised as Li-, Na- and K- borates.  Optimisations include Li-, Na- and K-ion coordination environments and P3HT polaron and bipolarons. Level of theory: ωb97xd/6-311G(d,p)/cpcm=DMSO.
